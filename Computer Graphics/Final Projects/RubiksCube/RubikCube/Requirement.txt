You should implement the RubiCube using OpenGL(programmable pipeline)
1) The whole RubiCube rotates when clicking the mouse left buttom and dragging it
2) The whole RubiCube changes its scale when scrolling the wheel
3) A layer of the RubiCube rotates when clicking the mouse right buttom and dragging it
4) The color or texture of each face in RubiCube are different


You should implement all the function with "TODO" in RubiCube.cpp
The task seems simpler. In this case, the challenge is to understand the code.
